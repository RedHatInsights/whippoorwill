= ApiGateway Provider

The *ApiGateway Provider* is responsible for collating public endpoints into a single aggregated
endpoint. In stage and production this mode is disabled. In local and ephemeral environments
it is used to offer a stage/prod like experience.

== ClowdApp Configuration

All applications that have the ``webServices.public.enabled`` set to ``true`` will be exposed via
the Caddy API gateway server. By default they will be exposed at the following path 
``api/<appName-deploymentName>/``. If an application requires to overide this path endpoint, it can
be achieved by the example below.

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: ingress
spec:
  deployments:
    name: service
    webServices:
      public:
        enabled: true
        apiEndpoint: ingress
----

In this example the app will be exposed via ``api/ingress/`` instead.

== ClowdEnv Configuration

The API gateway provider will only operate if the mode is set to `enabled`.
